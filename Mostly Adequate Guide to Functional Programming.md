# Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming
## First Class Functions
```javascript
// ignorant
const getServerStuff = callback => ajaxCall(json => callback(json));

// enlightened
const getServerStuff = ajaxCall;
```

The world is littered with ajax code exactly like this. Here is the reason both are equivalent:

```javascript
// this line
ajaxCall(json => callback(json));

// is the same as this line
ajaxCall(callback);

// so refactor getServerStuff
const getServerStuff = callback => ajaxCall(callback);

// ...which is equivalent to this
const getServerStuff = ajaxCall; // <-- look mum, no ()'s
```

And that, folks, is how it is done. Once more so that we understand why I'm being so persistent.

```javascript
const BlogController = {
  index(posts) { return Views.index(posts); },
  show(post) { return Views.show(post); },
  create(attrs) { return Db.create(attrs); },
  update(post, attrs) { return Db.update(post, attrs); },
  destroy(post) { return Db.destroy(post); },
};
```

This ridiculous controller is 99% fluff. We could either rewrite it as:

```javascript
const BlogController = {
  index: Views.index,
  show: Views.show,
  create: Db.create,
  update: Db.update,
  destroy: Db.destroy,
};
```

... or scrap it altogether since it does nothing more than just bundle our Views and Db together.

### Why Favor First Class?

Okay, let's get down to the reasons to favor first class functions. As we saw in the `getServerStuff` and `BlogController` examples, it's easy to add layers of indirection that provide no added value and only increase the amount of redundant code to maintain and search through.

In addition, if such a needlessly wrapped function must be changed, we must also need to change our wrapper function as well.

```javascript
httpGet('/post/2', json => renderPost(json));
```

If `httpGet` were to change to send a possible `err`, we would need to go back and change the "glue".

```javascript
// go back to every httpGet call in the application and explicitly pass err along.
httpGet('/post/2', (json, err) => renderPost(json, err));
Had we written it as a first class function, much less would need to change:
// renderPost is called from within httpGet with however many arguments it wants
httpGet('/post/2', renderPost);
```

Besides the removal of unnecessary functions, we must name and reference arguments. Names are a bit of an issue, you see. We have potential misnomers - especially as the codebase ages and requirements change.

## Pure Functions

Take slice and splice. They are two functions that do the exact same thing - in a vastly different way, mind you, but the same thing nonetheless. We say slice is pure because it returns the same output per input every time, guaranteed. splice, however, will chew up its array and spit it back out forever changed which is an observable effect.

```javascript
const xs = [1,2,3,4,5];

// pure
xs.slice(0,3); // [1,2,3]

xs.slice(0,3); // [1,2,3]

xs.slice(0,3); // [1,2,3]


// impure
xs.splice(0,3); // [1,2,3]

xs.splice(0,3); // [4,5]

xs.splice(0,3); // []
```

Side effects may include, but are not limited to
- changing the file system
- inserting a record into a database
- making an http call
- mutations
- printing to the screen / logging
- obtaining user input
- querying the DOM
- accessing system state

And the list goes on and on. Any interaction with the world outside of a function is a side effect, which is a fact that may prompt you to suspect the practicality of programming without them. **The philosophy of functional programming postulates that side effects are a primary cause of incorrect behavior.**

### The Case for Purity
#### Cacheable
For starters, pure functions can always be cached by input. This is typically done using a technique called memoization:

```javascript
const squareNumber = memoize(x => x * x);

squareNumber(4); // 16

squareNumber(4); // 16, returns cache for input 4

squareNumber(5); // 25

squareNumber(5); // 25, returns cache for input 5
```

Here is a simplified implementation, though there are plenty of more robust versions available.

```javascript
const memoize = (f) => {
  const cache = {};

  return (...args) => {
    const argStr = JSON.stringify(args);
    cache[argStr] = cache[argStr] || f(...args);
    return cache[argStr];
  };
};
```

Something to note is that you can transform some impure functions into pure ones by delaying evaluation:

```javascript
const pureHttpCall = memoize((url, params) => () => $.getJSON(url, params));
```

The interesting thing here is that we don't actually make the http call - we instead return a function that will do so when called. This function is pure because it will always return the same output given the same input: the function that will make the particular http call given the `url` and `params`.

Our `memoize` function works just fine, though it doesn't cache the results of the http call, rather it caches the generated function.

This is not very useful yet, but we'll soon learn some tricks that will make it so. The takeaway is that we can cache every function no matter how destructive they seem.

#### Portable / Self-documenting
Pure functions are completely self contained. Everything the function needs is handed to it on a silver platter. Ponder this for a moment... How might this be beneficial? For starters, a function's dependencies are explicit and therefore easier to see and understand - no funny business going on under the hood.

```javascript
// impure
const signUp = (attrs) => {
  const user = saveUser(attrs);
  welcomeUser(user);
};

// pure
const signUp = (Db, Email, attrs) => () => {
  const user = saveUser(Db, attrs);
  welcomeUser(Email, user);
};
```

The example here demonstrates that the pure function must be honest about its dependencies and, as such, tell us exactly what it's up to. Just from its signature, we know that it will use a `Db`, `Email`, and `attrs` which should be telling to say the least.

#### Reasonable
Many believe the biggest win when working with pure functions is *referential transparency*. A spot of code is referentially transparent when it can be substituted for its evaluated value without changing the behavior of the program.

Since pure functions don't have side effects, they can only influence the behavior of a program through their output values. Furthermore, since their output values can reliably be calculated using only their input values, pure functions will always preserve referential transparency. Let's see an example.

```javascript
const { Map } = require('immutable');

// Aliases: p = player, a = attacker, t = target
const jobe = Map({ name: 'Jobe', hp: 20, team: 'red' });
const michael = Map({ name: 'Michael', hp: 20, team: 'green' });
const decrementHP = p => p.set('hp', p.get('hp') - 1);
const isSameTeam = (p1, p2) => p1.get('team') === p2.get('team');
const punch = (a, t) => (isSameTeam(a, t) ? t : decrementHP(t));

punch(jobe, michael); // Map({name:'Michael', hp:19, team: 'green'})
```

`decrementHP`, `isSameTeam` and punch are all pure and therefore referentially transparent. We can use a technique called equational reasoning wherein one substitutes "equals for equals" to reason about code. It's a bit like manually evaluating the code without taking into account the quirks of programmatic evaluation. Using referential transparency, let's play with this code a bit.

First we'll inline the function `isSameTeam`.

```javascript
const punch = (a, t) => (a.get('team') === t.get('team') ? t : decrementHP(t));
```

Since our data is immutable, we can simply replace the teams with their actual value

```javascript
const punch = (a, t) => ('red' === 'green' ? t : decrementHP(t));
```

We see that it is false in this case so we can remove the entire if branch

```javascript
const punch = (a, t) => decrementHP(t);
```

And if we inline decrementHP, we see that, in this case, punch becomes a call to decrement the hp by 1.

```javascript
const punch = (a, t) => t.set('hp', t.get('hp') - 1);
```

#### Parallel Code
Finally, and here's the coup de grÃ¢ce, we can run any pure function in parallel since it does not need access to shared memory and it cannot, by definition, have a race condition due to some side effect.

This is very much possible in a server side JS environment with threads as well as in the browser with web workers though current culture seems to avoid it due to complexity when dealing with impure functions.

### Currying

```javascript
const match = curry((what, s) => s.match(what));
const replace = curry((what, replacement, s) => s.replace(what, replacement));
const filter = curry((f, xs) => xs.filter(f));
const map = curry((f, xs) => xs.map(f));
```

The pattern I've followed is a simple, but important one. I've strategically positioned the data we're operating on (`String`, `Array`) as the last argument. It will become clear as to why upon use.
(The syntax `/r/g` is a regular expression that means match every letter 'r'. Read more about regular expressions if you like.)
```javascript
match(/r/g, 'hello world'); // [ 'r' ]

const hasLetterR = match(/r/g); // x => x.match(/r/g)
hasLetterR('hello world'); // [ 'r' ]
hasLetterR('just j and s and t etc'); // null

filter(hasLetterR, ['rock and roll', 'smooth jazz']); // ['rock and roll']

const removeStringsWithoutRs = filter(hasLetterR); // xs => xs.filter(x => x.match(/r/g))
removeStringsWithoutRs(['rock and roll', 'smooth jazz', 'drum circle']); // ['rock and roll', 'drum circle']

const noVowels = replace(/[aeiou]/ig); // (r,x) => x.replace(/[aeiou]/ig, r)
const censored = noVowels('*'); // x => x.replace(/[aeiou]/ig, '*')
censored('Chocolate Rain'); // 'Ch*c*l*t* R**n'
```

What's demonstrated here is the ability to "pre-load" a function with an argument or two in order to receive a new function that remembers those arguments.

## Composition

In our definition of compose, the `g` will run before the `f`, creating a right to left flow of data. This is much more readable than nesting a bunch of function calls. Without compose, the above would read:


```javascript
const shout = x => exclaim(toUpperCase(x));
```
Instead of inside to outside, we run right to left, which I suppose is a step in the left direction (boo!). Let's look at an example where sequence matters:

```javascript
const head = x => x[0];
const reverse = reduce((acc, x) => [x, ...acc], []);
const last = compose(head, reverse);

last(['jumpkick', 'roundhouse', 'uppercut']); // 'uppercut'
```

`reverse` will turn the list around while head grabs the initial item. This results in an effective, albeit inefficient, `last` function. The sequence of functions in the composition should be apparent here. We could define a left to right version, however, we mirror the mathematical version much more closely as it stands. That's right, composition is straight from the math books. In fact, perhaps it's time to look at a property that holds for any composition.

```javascript
// associativity
compose(f, compose(g, h)) === compose(compose(f, g), h);
```

Composition is associative, meaning it doesn't matter how you group two of them. So, should we choose to uppercase the string, we can write:

```javascript
compose(toUpperCase, compose(head, reverse));
// or
compose(compose(toUpperCase, head), reverse);
```

Since it doesn't matter how we group our calls to compose, the result will be the same. That allows us to write a variadic compose and use it as follows:

```javascript
// previously we'd have to write two composes, but since it's associative,
// we can give compose as many fn's as we like and let it decide how to group them.
const arg = ['jumpkick', 'roundhouse', 'uppercut'];
const lastUpper = compose(toUpperCase, head, reverse);
const loudLastUpper = compose(exclaim, toUpperCase, head, reverse);

lastUpper(arg); // 'UPPERCUT'
loudLastUpper(arg); // 'UPPERCUT!'
```

Applying the associative property gives us this flexibility and peace of mind that the result will be equivalent. The slightly more complicated variadic definition is included with the support libraries for this book and is the normal definition you'll find in libraries like `lodash`, `underscore`, and `ramda`.

One pleasant benefit of associativity is that any group of functions can be extracted and bundled together in their very own composition. Let's play with refactoring our previous example:

```javascript
const loudLastUpper = compose(exclaim, toUpperCase, head, reverse);

// -- or ---------------------------------------------------------------

const last = compose(head, reverse);
const loudLastUpper = compose(exclaim, toUpperCase, last);

// -- or ---------------------------------------------------------------

const last = compose(head, reverse);
const angry = compose(exclaim, toUpperCase);
const loudLastUpper = compose(angry, last);

// more variations...
```

There's no right or wrong answers - we're just plugging our legos together in whatever way we please. Usually it's best to group things in a reusable way like last and angry. If familiar with Fowler's "Refactoring", one might recognize this process as "extract function"...except without all the object state to worry about.

#### Pointfree

Pointfree style means never having to say your data. Excuse me. It means functions that never mention the data upon which they operate. First class functions, currying, and composition all play well together to create this style.

```javascript
// not pointfree because we mention the data: word
const snakeCase = word => word.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/ig, '_');

// pointfree
const snakeCase = compose(replace(/\s+/ig, '_'), toLowerCase);
```

#### Debugging

If you are having trouble debugging a composition, we can use this helpful, but impure trace function to see what's going on.

```javascript
const trace = curry((tag, x) => {
  console.log(tag, x);
  return x;
});

const dasherize = compose(
  intercalate('-'),
  toLower,
  split(' '),
  replace(/\s{2,}/ig, ' '),
);

dasherize('The world is a vampire');
// TypeError: Cannot read property 'apply' of undefined
```

Something is wrong here, let's trace

```javascript
const dasherize = compose(
  intercalate('-'),
  toLower,
  trace('after split'),
  split(' '),
  replace(/\s{2,}/ig, ' '),
);

dasherize('The world is a vampire');
// after split [ 'The', 'world', 'is', 'a', 'vampire' ]
```

### Hindley-Milner Type Signatures

In HM, functions are written as `a -> b` where `a` and `b` are variables for any type. So the signatures for capitalize can be read as "a function from String to String". In other words, it takes a `String` as its input and returns a `String` as its output.

Let's look at some more function signatures:

```javascript
// strLength :: String -> Number
const strLength = s => s.length;

// join :: String -> [String] -> String
const join = curry((what, xs) => xs.join(what));

// match :: Regex -> String -> [String]
const match = curry((reg, s) => s.match(reg));

// replace :: Regex -> String -> String -> String
const replace = curry((reg, sub, s) => s.replace(reg, sub));
```

`strLength` is the same idea as before: we take a `String` and return you a `Number`.

The others might perplex you at first glance. Without fully understanding the details, you could always just view the last type as the return value. So for match you can interpret as: It takes a `Regex` and a `String` and returns you `[String]`. But an interesting thing is going on here that I'd like to take a moment to explain if I may.
For match we are free to group the signature like so:

```javascript
// match :: Regex -> (String -> [String])
const match = curry((reg, s) => s.match(reg));
```

Ah yes, grouping the last part in parenthesis reveals more information. Now it is seen as a function that takes a `Regex` and returns us a function from `String` to `[String]`. Because of currying, this is indeed the case: give it a `Regex` and we get a function back waiting for its `String` argument. Of course, we don't have to think of it this way, but it is good to understand why the last type is the one returned.

```javascript
// match :: Regex -> (String -> [String])
// onHoliday :: String -> [String]
const onHoliday = match(/holiday/ig);
```

Each argument pops one type off the front of the signature. `onHoliday` is match that already has a `Regex`.

```javascript
// replace :: Regex -> (String -> (String -> String))
const replace = curry((reg, sub, s) => s.replace(reg, sub));
```

As you can see with the full parenthesis on `replace`, the extra notation can get a little noisy and redundant so we simply omit them. We can give all the arguments at once if we choose so it's easier to just think of it as: `replace` takes a `Regex`, a `String`, another `String` and returns you a `String`.

Being able to reason about types and their implications is a skill that will take you far in the functional world. Not only will papers, blogs, docs, etc, become more digestible, but the signature itself will practically lecture you on its functionality. It takes practice to become a fluent reader, but if you stick with it, heaps of information will become available to you sans RTFMing.

Here's a few more just to see if you can decipher them on your own.

```javascript
// head :: [a] -> a
const head = xs => xs[0];

// filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
const filter = curry((f, xs) => xs.filter(f));

// reduce :: ((b, a) -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
const reduce = curry((f, x, xs) => xs.reduce(f, x));
```

### Free Theorems

Besides deducing implementation possibilities, this sort of reasoning gains us free theorems. What follows are a few random example theorems lifted directly from Wadler's paper on the subject.

```javascript
// head :: [a] -> a
compose(f, head) === compose(head, map(f));

// filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
compose(map(f), filter(compose(p, f))) === compose(filter(p), map(f));
```

You don't need any code to get these theorems, they follow directly from the types. The first one says that if we get the `head` of our array, then run some function `f` on it, that is equivalent to, and incidentally, much faster than, if we first `map(f)` over every element then take the `head` of the result.

You might think, well that's just common sense. But last I checked, computers don't have common sense. Indeed, they must have a formal way to automate these kind of code optimizations. Maths has a way of formalizing the intuitive, which is helpful amidst the rigid terrain of computer logic.

The `filter` theorem is similar. It says that if we compose `f` and `p` to check which should be filtered, then actually apply the `f` via `map` (remember filter will not transform the elements - its signature enforces that a will not be touched), it will always be equivalent to mapping our `f` then filtering the result with the `p` predicate.

### Constraints
One last thing to note is that we can constrain types to an interface.

```javascript
// sort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
```

What we see on the left side of our fat arrow here is the statement of a fact: a must be an `Ord`. Or in other words, a must implement the `Ord` interface. What is `Ord` and where did it come from? In a typed language it would be a defined interface that says we can order the values. This not only tells us more about the a and what our sort function is up to, but also restricts the domain. We call these interface declarations type constraints.

```javascript
// assertEqual :: (Eq a, Show a) => a -> a -> Assertion
```

Here, we have two constraints: `Eq` and `Show`. Those will ensure that we can check equality of our as and print the difference if they are not equal.

## Containers

```javascript
class Container {
  constructor(x) {
    this.$value = x;
  }

  static of(x) {
    return new Container(x);
  }
}
...
Container.of(3);
// Container(3)

Container.of('hotdogs');
// Container("hotdogs")

Container.of(Container.of({ name: 'yoda' }));
// Container(Container({ name: 'yoda' }))
```

### Functors

> A Functor is a type that implements map and obeys some laws

Yes, Functor is simply an interface with a contract. We could have just as easily named it Mappable, but now, where's the fun in that? Functors come from category theory and we'll look at the maths in detail toward the end of the chapter, but for now, let's work on intuition and practical uses for this bizarrely named interface.
What reason could we possibly have for bottling up a value and using map to get at it? The answer reveals itself if we choose a better question: What do we gain from asking our container to apply functions for us? Well, abstraction of function application. When we map a function, we ask the container type to run it for us. This is a very powerful concept, indeed.

```javascript
// (a -> b) -> Container a -> Container b
Container.prototype.map = function (f) {
  return Container.of(f(this.$value));
};
...
Container.of(2).map(two => two + 2);
// Container(4)

Container.of('flamethrowers').map(s => s.toUpperCase());
// Container('FLAMETHROWERS')

Container.of('bombs').map(append(' away')).map(prop('length'));
// Container(10)
```

### Maybe

```javascript
class Maybe {
  static of(x) {
    return new Maybe(x);
  }

  get isNothing() {
    return this.$value === null || this.$value === undefined;
  }

  constructor(x) {
    this.$value = x;
  }

  map(fn) {
    return this.isNothing ? this : Maybe.of(fn(this.$value));
  }

  inspect() {
    return this.isNothing ? 'Nothing' : `Just(${inspect(this.$value)})`;
  }
}

Maybe.of('Malkovich Malkovich').map(match(/a/ig));
// Just(True)

Maybe.of(null).map(match(/a/ig));
// Nothing

Maybe.of({ name: 'Boris' }).map(prop('age')).map(add(10));
// Nothing

Maybe.of({ name: 'Dinah', age: 14 }).map(prop('age')).map(add(10));
// Just(24)
```

#### Use Cases

```javascript
// safeHead :: [a] -> Maybe(a)
const safeHead = xs => Maybe.of(xs[0]);

// streetName :: Object -> Maybe String
const streetName = compose(map(prop('street')), safeHead, prop('addresses'));

streetName({ addresses: [] });
// Nothing

streetName({ addresses: [{ street: 'Shady Ln.', number: 4201 }] });
// Just('Shady Ln.')

// withdraw :: Number -> Account -> Maybe(Account)
const withdraw = curry((amount, { balance }) =>
  Maybe.of(balance >= amount ? { balance: balance - amount } : null));

// This function is hypothetical, not implemented here... nor anywhere else.
// updateLedger :: Account -> Account
const updateLedger = account => account;

// remainingBalance :: Account -> String
const remainingBalance = ({ balance }) => `Your balance is $${balance}`;

// finishTransaction :: Account -> String
const finishTransaction = compose(remainingBalance, updateLedger);


// getTwenty :: Account -> Maybe(String)
const getTwenty = compose(map(finishTransaction), withdraw(20));

getTwenty({ balance: 200.00 });
// Just('Your balance is $180')

getTwenty({ balance: 10.00 });
// Nothing
```
